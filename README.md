# Project Goal
The objective is to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on various characteristics such as cap shape, cap color, and gill color.   
A real-world dataset from Kaggle is utilized for this analysis.

## 1. Data Acquisition and Initial Exploration
The dataset is imported using Pandas and examined using functions like head(), tail(), shape, and info(). The target variable (class) consists of two categories: ‚Äòe‚Äô (edible) and ‚Äòp‚Äô (poisonous). The dataset is checked for missing values (none detected), and column-wise statistics are reviewed using describe().

## 2. Data Preprocessing
Since the dataset contains categorical features, Label Encoding is applied to convert them into numerical values. The independent variables are stored in X, while the target variable is assigned to y.

## 3. Feature Reduction with PCA
To improve computational efficiency while retaining 85% of the dataset‚Äôs variance, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed. This reduces the number of dimensions without losing critical information.

## 4. Splitting Data for Training and Testing
The dataset is divided into 80% training and 20% testing subsets using train_test_split from the sklearn library.

## 5. Model Development
Several machine learning models are trained and compared, including:    

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  

## 6. Model Evaluation
Each model‚Äôs performance is assessed using the accuracy_score metric. A comparative analysis is conducted to determine the most effective model.

## 7. Model Deployment and Prediction
The Random Forest model, which demonstrated the best accuracy, is retrained on the entire dataset and saved using joblib. The saved model is then utilized in Python to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

## 8. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Implementation
A user-friendly interface is developed using the Tkinter library. This GUI allows users to input mushroom characteristics and receive real-time classification results.

# Final Insights or Conclusion : Why Random Forest Performed Best?
## 1. Handling Categorical Features:
The dataset is composed of categorical variables (e.g., cap shape, gill color), and Random Forest is highly effective at capturing relationships within categorical data.

## 2. Capturing Complex Patterns:
The classification problem likely involves non-linear and hierarchical relationships. Random Forest, being an ensemble method, can recognize intricate patterns better than simpler models like Logistic Regression or SVM.

## 3. Balanced Target Classes:
If the dataset has a nearly equal distribution of edible and poisonous mushrooms, Random Forest‚Äôs ensemble approach ensures a balanced classification without bias toward a specific category.

## 4. Robustness to Noise:
Unlike single decision trees, Random Forest is resistant to overfitting and performs well even with noisy data, leading to more reliable test results.

## 5. Impact of PCA:
Applying PCA reduced the dataset to 7 principal components while retaining 85% of the original variance. This dimensionality reduction enhanced computational efficiency and helped Random Forest focus on significant patterns, improving accuracy.
